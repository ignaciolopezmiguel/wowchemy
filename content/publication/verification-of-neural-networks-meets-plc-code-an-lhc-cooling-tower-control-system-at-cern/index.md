abstract: In the last few years, control engineers have started to use
  artificial neural networks (NNs) embedded in advanced feedback control
  algorithms. Its natural integration into existing controllers, such as
  programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or close to them, represents a
  challenge. Besides, the application of these algorithms in critical
  applications still raises concerns among control engineers due to the lack of
  safety guarantees. Building trustworthy NNs is still a challenge and their
  verification is attracting more attention nowadays. This paper discusses the
  peculiarities of formal verification of NNs controllers running on PLCs. It
  outlines a set of properties that should be satisfied by a NN that is intended
  to be deployed in a critical high-availability installation at CERN. It
  compares different methods to verify this NN and sketches our future research
  directions to find a safe NN
