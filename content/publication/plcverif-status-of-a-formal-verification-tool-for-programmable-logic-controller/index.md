abstract: PLCverif was first released internally for CERN usage in 2019 and is
  available to everyone since September 2020 via an open source licence. In this
  paper, we will first give an overview of the PLCverif platform capabilities
  before focusing on the improvements done since 2019 such as the larger support
  coverage of the Siemens PLC programming languages, the better support of the C
  Bounded Model Checker backend (CBMC) and the process of releasing PLCverif as
  an open-source software.
