abstract: An important aspect of many particle accelerators is the constant
  evolution and frequent configuration changes that are needed to perform the
  experiments they are designed for. This often leads to the design of
  configurable software that can absorb these changes and perform the required
  control and protection actions. This design strategy minimizes the engineering
  and maintenance costs, but it makes the software verification activities more
  challenging since safety properties must be guaranteed for any of the possible
  configurations. Software model checking is a popular automated verification
  technique in many industries. This verification method explores all possible
  combinations of the system model to guarantee its compliance with certain
  properties or specification. This is a very appropriate technique for highly
  configurable software, since there is usually an enormous amount of
  combinations to be checked. This paper presents how PLCverif, a CERN model
  checking platform, has been applied to a highly configurable Programmable
  Logic Controller (PLC) program, the SPS Personnel Protection System (PPS). The
  benefits and challenges of this verification approach are also discussed.
