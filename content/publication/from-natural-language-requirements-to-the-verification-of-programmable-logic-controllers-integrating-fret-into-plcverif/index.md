abstract: PLCverif is an actively developed project at CERN, enabling the formal
  verification of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs in critical
  systems. In this paper, we present our work on improving the formal
  requirements specification experience in PLCverif through the use of natural
  language. To this end, we integrate NASA’s FRET, a formal requirement
  elicitation and authoring tool, into PLCverif. FRET is used to specify formal
  requirements in structured natural language, which automatically translates
  into temporal logic formulae. FRET’s output is then directly used by PLCverif
  for verification purposes. We discuss practical challenges that PLCverif users
  face when authoring requirements and the FRET features that help alleviate
  these problems. We present the new requirement formalization workflow and
  report our experience using it on two critical CERN case studies.
