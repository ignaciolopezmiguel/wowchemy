  Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has fueled a revolution in
  several scientific fields.

  Intelligent agents can now give medical advice, translate spoken language, recommend news, and

  drive different types of vehicles, to name but a few. Some of these agents need to interact with

  humans and, hence, need to adhere to their social norms. Safety engineers have always worked

  with critical systems in which catastrophic failures can occur. They need to make moral decisions

  in order to keep the system under some acceptable risk level. In this paper, we will propose an

  approach to give a value to contrary-to-duty behaviors by introducing a risk aversion factor. We will

  make use of decision theory with uncertain consequences together with a risk matrix used by

  safety engineers. We will successfully exemplify this approach with the problem in which an

  autonomous car needs to decide whether to run a red light or not.
