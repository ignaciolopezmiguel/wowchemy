abstract: The increased technological complexity and demand for software
  reliability require organizations to formally design and verify their
  safety-critical programs to minimize systematic failures. Formal methods are
  recommended by functional safety standards (e.g., by IEC 61511 for the process
  industry and by the generic IEC 61508) and play a crucial role. Their
  structured approach reduces ambiguity in system requirements, facilitating
  early error detection. This paper introduces a formal verification service for
  PLC (programmable logic controller) programs compliant with functional safety
  standards, providing external expertise to organizations while eliminating the
  need for extensive internal training. It offers a cost-effective solution to
  meet the rising demands for formal verification processes. The approach is
  extended to include modeling time-dependent, know-how-protected components,
  enabling formal verification of real safety-critical applications. A case
  study shows the application of PLC formal verification as a service provided
  by CERN in a safety-critical installation at the GSI particle accelerator
  facility.
