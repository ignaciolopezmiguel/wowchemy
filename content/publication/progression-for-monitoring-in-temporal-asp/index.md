abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the application of
  temporal reasoning approaches and non-monotonic logics from artificial
  intelligence in dynamic systems that generate data. A well-known approach to
  temporal reasoning is the use of a progression technique, which allows for the
  online computation of logical consequences of a logical knowledge base over
  time. We consider a progression technique for Temporal Here and There and
  Temporal Equilibrium Logic, which is the logic underlying answer programming
  over linear-temporal logic (LTL). Compared to usual LTL online computation,
  where the goal is to check whether a trace is compliant with a temporal
  specification, our approach provides also the means to compute non-monotonic
  temporal reasoning over a trace of observations. Besides formal notions and
  results, we also present an algorithm for performing progression to monitor a
  dynamic system, which has been implemented as a proof of concept and allows
  for handling expressive application scenarios.
