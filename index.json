However, despite the benefits and recommendations of the functional safety standards, such as IEC 61508 and IEC 61511, formal verification is not yet a common practice in the process industry and large scientific installations. This is mainly due to its complexity and the need for formal methods experts. \nAt CERN, the PLCverif tool was developed to verify PLC programs formally. Although PLCverif hides most of the complexity of using formal methods and removes barriers to formally verifying PLC programs, engineers trying to verify their developments still encounter different obstacles. These challenges include the formalization of program specifications or the creation of formal models.\nThis paper discusses how to overcome these obstacles by proposing a collaboration model that effectively allows the verification of critical PLC programs and promotes knowledge transfer between organizations. By providing a simpler and more accessible way to carry out formal verification, tools like PLCverif can play a crucial role in achieving this goal. The collaboration model splits the specification, development, and verification tasks between organizations. This approach is illustrated through a case study between GSI and CERN.","tags":null,"title":"Working Together for Safer Systems: A Collaboration Model for Verification of PLC Code","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Soldà","Ignacio D.

It works efficiently when the number of input variables is limited, their interaction is small and, thus, the number of states the program can reach is not large. As observed in the large code base of the CERN industrial PLC applications, this is usually not the case: it thus leads to the well-known state-space explosion problem, making it impossible to perform model checking. One of the main reasons that causes state-space explosion is the inclusion of numeric variables due to the wide range of values they can take. In this paper, we propose an approach to discretize PLC input numeric variables (modelled as non-deterministic). This discretization is complemented with a set of transformations on the control-flow automaton that models the PLC program so that no extra behaviours are added. This approach is then quantitatively evaluated with a set of empirical tests using the PLC model checking framework PLCverif and three different state-of-the-art model checkers (CBMC, nuXmv, and Theta), showing beneficial results for binary-decision-diagram-based model checkers.","tags":null,"title":"Simplification of numeric variables for PLC model checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Borja Fernández Adiego","Ignacio D.

This often leads to the design of configurable software that can absorb these changes and perform the required control and protection actions. This design strategy minimizes the engineering and maintenance costs, but it makes the software verification activities more challenging since safety properties must be guaranteed for any of the possible configurations. Software model checking is a popular automated verification technique in many industries. This verification method explores all possible combinations of the system model to guarantee its compliance with certain properties or specification. This is a very appropriate technique for highly configurable software, since there is usually an enormous amount of combinations to be checked. This paper presents how PLCverif, a CERN model checking platform, has been applied to a highly configurable Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program, the SPS Personnel Protection System (PPS).
