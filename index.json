Intelligent agents can now give medical advice, translate spoken language, recommend news, and drive different types of vehicles, to name but a few. Some of these agents need to interact with humans and, hence, need to adhere to their social norms. Safety engineers have always worked with critical systems in which catastrophic failures can occur. They need to make moral decisions in order to keep the system under some acceptable risk level. In this paper, we will propose an approach to give a value to contrary-to-duty behaviors by introducing a risk aversion factor. We will make use of decision theory with uncertain consequences together with a risk matrix used by safety engineers. We will successfully exemplify this approach with the problem in which an autonomous car needs to decide whether to run a red light or not.","tags":null,"title":"Stop at red?

It works efficiently when the number of input variables is limited, their interaction is small and, thus, the number of states the program can reach is not large. As observed in the large code base of the CERN industrial PLC applications, this is usually not the case: it thus leads to the well-known state-space explosion problem, making it impossible to perform model checking. One of the main reasons that causes state-space explosion is the inclusion of numeric variables due to the wide range of values they can take. In this paper, we propose an approach to discretize PLC input numeric variables (modelled as non-deterministic). This discretization is complemented with a set of transformations on the control-flow automaton that models the PLC program so that no extra behaviours are added. This approach is then quantitatively evaluated with a set of empirical tests using the PLC model checking framework PLCverif and three different state-of-the-art model checkers (CBMC, nuXmv, and Theta), showing beneficial results for binary-decision-diagram-based model checkers.","tags":null,"title":"Simplification of numeric variables for PLC model checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Borja Fernández Adiego","Ignacio D.

This often leads to the design of configurable software that can absorb these changes and perform the required control and protection actions. This design strategy minimizes the engineering and maintenance costs, but it makes the software verification activities more challenging since safety properties must be guaranteed for any of the possible configurations. Software model checking is a popular automated verification technique in many industries. This verification method explores all possible combinations of the system model to guarantee its compliance with certain properties or specification. This is a very appropriate technique for highly configurable software, since there is usually an enormous amount of combinations to be checked. This paper presents how PLCverif, a CERN model checking platform, has been applied to a highly configurable Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program, the SPS Personnel Protection System (PPS). The benefits and challenges of this verification approach are also discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Applying Model Checking to Highly-Configurable Safety Critical Software: The SPS-PPS PLC Program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ignacio D.
